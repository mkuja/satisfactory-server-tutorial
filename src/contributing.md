## How to
This... abomination is written using mdbook. If you want to improve
it, please install rust toolchain using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
After that use the command `cargo install mdbook` and you should be able to
compile it locally. I also use [this](https://crates.io/crates/http-server)
crate for serving it locally. To install, just `cargo install http-server`
and you should have `http-server` command.
